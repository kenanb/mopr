**HEAVILY EXPERIMENTAL AND UNTESTED CODE. DO NOT USE!**

My personal framework for my own OpenUSD related experiments, mainly in Lisp.

Partial code, only shared for referencing from my blog posts for now.

I also won't accept pull requests, at least until I am confident that the current BSD-3-Clause is the right license.
